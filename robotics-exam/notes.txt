1. Bang-Coast-Bang vs Bang-Bang: a coast exists when L > V_max^2 / A_max

2. To check since I am not sure about this one:

if you want continuous acceleration profile you need to use cubic/quintic etc. since bang-(coast-)bang has a discontinous acceleration profile

If you want the minimum motion time bang-(coast-)bang is the way to go, since it's optimal while cubic/quintic is not


3. look at the manual for the difference between RF_n and RF_e
