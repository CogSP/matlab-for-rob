	- ex 2: why alpha(t) can be maximum at the boundaries tau = 0 and tau = 1? Is it a general
	  rule for the norm? I think the answer can be in the footnote #2 but I didn't understand
	- ex 3: to complete from the minor study

	- ex 2: inequalities at the start of the solution
		why using det(A) to compute q1 when we have the 2R formulas?
	- ex 4: why acceleration is 0 at tau = 0 if the velocity is not zero?

	- ex 4: how to calculate the secondary workspace?
	- ex 6: TODO

	- ex 1c: I didn't understand how the consequences illustrated by the professor can be
	possible
	- ex 2: note that I have used algebraic transformation in the exercise. So put it on
	github. The other factor is using the common technique of checking if the factor it's
	derivable from the direct kinematic
